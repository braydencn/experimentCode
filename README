Sometimes I work with experiment programs. 
Will put them into this repository for references.

bi_pipe_parent.c
bi_pipe_child.c
-- A sample code for implement bi-directional pipe, 
eg, let the parent code be able to read the standard output and
standard input of the child program. Just use two pipes, 
 Pipe1 -- parent read, child write
 pipe2 -- parent write, child read  
To run the programe, use:
 gcc -o parent bi_pipe_parent.c && gcc -o child bi_pipe_child.c && ./parent
